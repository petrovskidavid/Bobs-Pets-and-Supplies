# Bob's Pets and Supplies - CSCI 466 E-Commerce Project
by David Petrovski, Isabelle Coletti, Amanda Zedwick

## Bobs Pets and Supplies
This is the repo for our E-Commerce project. This website is an online pet supplies store, where you have the ability to create an account, put items in your cart and make fake purchases. Furthermore, there is an employee portal where the employees can pick which order they wish to "fulfill" and then "ship out" which will then give the customer a "tracking number" for their order and the status will be updated.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT put real credit card infromation when making the fake purchases.**

### Login Credentials
To login as a customer or employee use the following credentials
- Username: **admin**
- Password: **12345678**

Note: The passwords are encrypted in the database for a basic form of protection for the users accounts.

Give the website a look at: http://students.cs.niu.edu/~z1894079/csci466/Bobs-Pets-and-Supplies

Thank you!
